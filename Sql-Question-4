Product recommendation. Just the basic type (“customers who bought this also bought…”). That, in its simplest form, is an outcome of basket analysis. In this video we will learn how to find products which are most frequently bought together using simple SQL. Based on the history ecommerce website can recommend products to new user.


Here is the ready script to practice it:

create table orders
(
order_id int,
customer_id int,
product_id int,
);

insert into orders VALUES 
(1, 1, 1),
(1, 1, 2),
(1, 1, 3),
(2, 2, 1),
(2, 2, 2),
(2, 2, 4),
(3, 1, 5);

create table products (
id int,
name varchar(10)
);
insert into products VALUES 
(1, 'A'),
(2, 'B'),
(3, 'C'),
(4, 'D'),
(5, 'E');




select * from orderss;
select * from products;


select p1.name, p2.name , count(1)
from orderss o1
inner join orderss o2 on o1.order_id = o2.order_id
inner join products p1 on p1.id = o1.product_id
inner join products p2 on p2.id = o2.product_id
where o1.product_id < o2.product_id
group by  p1.name, p2.name
